Differences between MAD-X and MAD-NG

SURVEY command:
———————————————
- MAD-X does not consider the sequence attribute.[BUG]
- MAD-X does not apply bv flag to tilt, theta, phi, psi.[BUG]
- MAD-X does not save tilt (and others angles?) when ranges are specified.[BUG]
- MAD-X does not consider the RBARC option (forced to true).
- MAD-X does not support xrotation and translation elements (frame). 
- MAD-X does not allow to survey only one element or few elements at a time.
- MAD-X considers multipoles k0l and k0sl to compute angle and tilt.
- MAD-X consider the sequence and the range from USE command.

- MAD use matrix formula (simpler).
- MAD considers sequences directions (i.e. MAD-X bv flag).
- MAD considers always angle and tilt instead of k0l and k0sl of multipoles. 
- MAD does not save slot_id, assembly_id, mech_sep and v_pos by default (N/A).
- MAD does not consider the add_pass (rbend) option (N/A).
- MAD allows to call survey in a much more flexible way.
- MAD allows to call survey with an already existing table and/or map.
- MAD allows to call survey on ranges specified by indexes, element or element names.
- MAD allows to save survey data on entry, exit (default) or none.
- MAD allows to not save data for implicit drifts.
- MAD allows to create customised survey commands
- MAD allows to attach customised survey commands to objects (i.e. sequences).
