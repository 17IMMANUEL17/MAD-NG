NAME
  plot

SYNOPSIS
  my_plot = plot 'myplot' { parameters... }

DESCRIPTION
  This module prides an high level interface to 'gnuplot' a cross-platform
  command-line graphing utility (See http://www.gnuplot.info/). It requires
  gnuplot 5+ to be installed to work and this documentation will heavily lean on
  the gnuplot documentation (available at
  http://www.gnuplot.info/docs_5.0/gnuplot.pdf).

  It works by generating a gnuplot script and passing it to an instance of
  gnuplot using gplot to manage this resources (See gplot).

  This command offers two main functionalities:
    - A user-friendly way to dump data to gnuplot (to generate plots)
    - The generation of a gnuplot script to create a layout from a sequence.

RETURN VALUE
  The plot command.

EXAMPLES
  -- Simple example that plot the "y1" column of tbl against the line indexes
  -- and show the layout of seq on top.
  -- See tests for more examples.
  plot {
    sequence = seq,
    table    = tbl,
    x1y1     = "y1",
  }

__help['plot.sid'] = [=[
NAME
  sid

SYNOPSIS
  plot.sid

DESCRIPTION
  The sid is used by the plot command to configure the gplot object
  (See gplot.sid for more). You might want to use multiple gnuplot instances for
  many reasons but here are a few possibilities :
    - If you want to have multiple pdf open for creation, then  use one sid per
    pdf because changing the name of the ouptut pdf will close the previous one
    and once closed, it can not be extended anymore.
    - If you want to have multiple interactive windows at the same time, then
    you should use one sid per window because inside a same gnuplot instances
    only the last one will be interactive.

RETURN VALUE
  The command sid.

NAME
  output, scrdump

SYNOPSIS
  plot.output
  plot.scrdump

DESCRIPTION
  output set the output mode.
    - A number value will use the windows terminal set by the "term" parameter
  and create a windows with this number as id. A single gnuplot instances can
  have multiple windows designated by the output number.
    - A string value will use the "pdfcairo" terminal and generate a pdf
  file with this string as name.

  scrdump is the name of the file where the gnuplot script will be saved.
  a nil value means that the scrdump is not saved (default)

RETURN VALUES
  the output mode as a number or a string.
  the scrdump filename as a string.

EXAMPLES
  -- example to create a "wxt" window with an id of 2 and not save the script.
  plot {
    [...]

DESCRIPTION
  Both data and table contains columns of data to be plotted. Those columns can
  be themselves of type table or vector. Columns to be plotted are selected by
  name (i.e. see plot.x1y1). the columns are first searched in data then if not
  found, in table. Columns in data have to be provided with correct length,
  while a range can be provided in tablerange for columns in table.

RETURN VALUES
  data as a table of columns of data to be plotted.
  table as a mtable containing columns of data to be plotted.
  tablerange compatible with range of mtable.

EXAMPLES
  -- This example will plot "y1" against "x1" an "y2" against "x2".
  -- where "x√Ü1 is a vector and "y2" a table will be found in data.
  -- and x2, y2 will be searched as columns in the mtable "mtbl" and only

SYNOPSIS
  plot.sequence
  plot.range
  plot.seqdisty
  plot.seqdistx
  plot.seqshift
  plot.nturn
  plot.X0
  plot.A0

DESCRIPTION
  sequence is the sequence or table of sequences from which the layout will be
  plotted. range is the range or table of range from which the layout will be
  plotted. seqdisty allows to position the different sequences along the y axis
  relatively to the first sequence of the list. If seqdisty is a number then all
  subsequent sequences will position at seqdisty to the first one. if seqdisty
  is a table then each i-th value correspond to the distance between the 1st
  and the (i+1)-th sequence. seqdistx is similar to seqdisty but along the x
  axis. seqshift shift all sequences along the x axis (needed to have correct
  spos for subsequence layout as layout always start at spos=0). nturn, x0, A0
  are compatible with survey and represent the number of turn of the sequence
  to be plotted and the initial position and rotation for the surveys.

RETURN VALUES
  sequence has a sequence or table of sequences.
  range compatible with sequence range.
  seqdisty, seqdistx as numbers or tables of numbers.
  seqshift, nturn as numbers.
  X0 and A0 as tables compatible with survey X0 and A0.

EXAMPLES
  -- plot the layout of the two lhc beam around IP5. seqdisty use the mechanical
  -- separation to ajust the distance between the two beam allong the y axis.
  -- seqshift shift the two beam to the correct spos (layout start at 0 by
  -- default).

  plot.laypos
  plot.laysize
  plot.elemname
  plot.elemwidth
  plot.elemscale
  plot.elemminlen
  plot.layangle
  plot.kindselect

DESCRIPTION
  laypos is the position of the layout. It can be a string : "top", "bottom",
  or middle to place it relatively to the plot. It can be a number (0 < y < 1)
  representing the position along the y axis, using screen coordinate (see
  gnuplot documentation). The string "in" will draw the layout inside the plot
  using survey. laysize is the total size taken by the layout along the y axis
  in screen coordinate. elemname is a boolean activating or not the labeling of
  elements (hover over the center of an element with you mouse to see its name
  and its kind). elemwidth, base width of layout element. elemscale, multiplier
  applied to elemwidth. elemminlen allows to filter element to be drawn by their
  length. layangle boolean that activate or not the use of the layangle flags of
  elements to take into account their angle in the layout. kindselect filters
  element to be drawn by their kind. kindcolor allows to choose the fillcolor
  and fillstyle (see gnuplot documentation) for each kind of element. Setting it
  to true will use default color and fillstyle.

RETURN VALUES
  laypos as a string or a number.
  elemname, layangle as a boolean.
  elemwidth, laysize, elemscale, elemminlen as numbers.
  kindselect as a table.
  kindcolor as a boolean, or table.

EXAMPLES

  -- take 40% of the screen, name of element will be shown if hover over their
  -- center, their width will be proportionally set to 0.07*1.5 meters, all
  -- element smaller than 3 meters will not be drawn, the angle of flagged
  -- element will be used and finally only quadrupole in blue and sbend in solid
  -- red will be drawn.

__help['gplot:is_busy'] = [=[
NAME
  is_busy

SYNOPSIS
  gplot:is_busy()

DESCRIPTION
  The is_busy method tells if the corresponding gnuplot is still processing the
  script provided by a previous plot command. NB: it doesn't take into account
  the command sent through gplot directly. It can be use to test if the previous
  command is done before executing a new one (avoiding a blocking wait if the
  maximum number of tmp file is reached : see clean_tmpFile).

RETURN VALUE
  It returns a boolean indicating if the corresponding gnuplot is busy.

EXAMPLES
  gplot:is_busy()                       -- =false
  plot { prolog = "pause 5" }           -- pause during 5 seconds
