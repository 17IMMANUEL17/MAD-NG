Known problems:
---------------

Object model can be slow for attribute lookup. Fast TDUP could be a solution for
moving back to something equivalent to MAD-X model. An alternative would be to
write-back attribute after each deep lookup such that next read has zero depth.

Sequence is overdesigned and should not allow inheritance or write protection
beyond the object model. Inheritance like needs should be implemented by bline.

MTable is overdesigned and should not allow inheritance or write protection
beyond the object model. There is no real need for inheritance with data.

Sequence has bugs, as flatten loose the formation about sub sequences and blines
(maintained only during construction), leading to unsolvable errors with update.

MTable has bugs, as column points to cidx and does not maintain a separate list
of column names, leading to errors with add/inscol.

MADX rbarc option trigs numerical discrepencies in sequence dump.
