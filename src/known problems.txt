Object model can be slow for attribute lookup. Fast TDUP could be a solution for
moving back to something equivalent to MAD-X model. An alternative would be to
write-back attribute after each deep lookup such that next read has zero depth.
**Note 20180912: this alternate object model has been implemented in MAD to
  support MADX like "object model", i.e. sharing behavior through deferred
  expressions. But it requires a significant amount of effort on some modules
  (e.g. sequence and subsequences) and to update the tests (e.g. object).

Sequence is overdesigned and should not allow inheritance and write protection
beyond the object model. Inheritance like needs should be implemented by bline
for subsequences.
**Note 20180912: making sequence instances 'final' would be a first step to
  check the implication of such design change.

MTable is overdesigned and should not allow inheritance or write protection
beyond the object model. There is no real need for inheritance with data.
**Note 20180912: making mtable instances 'final' would be a first step to
  check the implication of such design change.

Sequence has bugs, as flatten loose the formation about subsequences and blines
(maintained only during construction), leading to unsolvable errors with update.
With the alternate object model, writing back updated 'at' on cloned elements
could be a (dirty) solution.

MTable has bugs, 'column' points to cidx and does not maintain a separate list
of column names, leading to errors after add/inscol since generators cannot be
inserted beetween data columns, hence the order is broken. cidx should be cloned
when such situation is detected and column should be update by further add/ins.

MADX rbarc option trigs significant numerical discrepencies in sequence dump set
by the use of sin in the formula. This feature should be remove from MAD (and
MADX).
