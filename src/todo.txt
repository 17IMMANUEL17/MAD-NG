top-down todo list of tasks:
----------------------------

todo (small tasks):
- add remove col, remove row to matrix C module.
- split track and survey from elements methods :track and :survey.
- check policy of option.debug vs command info, summary or debug.
- improve MADX converter to handle mult. line def. and mult. def. per line.
- redo map diagonal blocks from beta0 block in bet2map (uniq solution exists?).
- review phase advance for backtracking.
- extend show to call method __show if it exists.
- replace reshapeto_ by append_ to vector/matrix in mtable.
- review slices indexes (and positions) for backtracking (+ entry & exit).
- check why profiler allows faster runs by 30%.
- check why C errors raise segfault (backtrace?) from time to time.
- check angle vs k0l in multipole element (might need another kickh)
- patch for fast table copy (and more), recheck object model performance.
- check object models performances (after improvement of maps speed).
- windows version.

todo (big tasks):
- orbit correction command.
- jacobian algorithm.
- aperture n1 estimate.
- documentation (latex, pdf, online).
- command for field errors from tables or files.
- command for misalignment errors from tables or files.
- improve speed of maps.
- improve speed of objects (copy on creation, fast copy?).
- improve speed of sequences (see todo in file).
- improve speed of mtables (see todo in file).
- module for managing particle vs damap and their attributes
- radiation (with Andrea).
- beam beam (with Piotr).
- true rbend.
- dispersion in 6D and Chao method (?)
- curved quadrupole (eh*k0l) (?).
- focusing sbend (?).
- support for knobs.
- fast tracking.
- high order normal form.
- readline (rlfe, linenoise), feasible?.
- replace jit.flush by faster alternatives (?).

- rename fnone to fnil.
- new policy of actions (track, survey) to fix twiss.
- stabilise blocks of R.
- fill summary table.
- check that user beta0 block contains enough init data (i.e. mu).
- make cummulated twiss calculation independent of save and mtable.
