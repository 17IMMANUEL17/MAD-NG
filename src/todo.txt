top-down todo list of tasks:
----------------------------

todo (small tasks):
- split track and survey from elements methods :track and :survey.
- review phase advance for backtracking.
- review slices indexes (and positions) for backtracking (+ entry & exit).
- remove Y scheme in seq:share method to behave like MADX
- review C errors (raise segfault, backtrace?), use callback and jit flush.
- check policy of option.debug vs command info or debug.
- review _data key (pointer) vs __data key (string) in sequence and mtable.
- review orientation and misalignment storage (in "node" or element).
- review index_of of mtable vs sequence.
- review vector specialization in mtable, replace by table and col mth tovector.
- replace reshapeto_ by append_ to vector/matrix in mtable.
- improve MADX converter to handle mult. line def. and mult. def. per line.
- redo map diagonal blocks from beta0 block in bet2map (uniq solution exists?).
- extend show to call method __show if it exists.
- check why profiler allows faster runs by 30%.
- check angle vs k0l in multipole element (might need another kickh)
- patch for fast table copy (and more), recheck object model performance.
- check object models performances (after improvement of maps speed).
- windows version.

todo (big tasks):
- aperture n1 estimate.
- documentation (latex, pdf, online).
- command for field errors from tables or files.
- command for misalignment errors from tables or files.
- improve speed of maps (alloc+intrf 70%, method 4 vs 2, chrom vs HO, skip t).
- improve speed of objects (copy on creation, fast copy?).
- improve speed of sequences (see todo in file).
- improve speed of mtables (see todo in file).
- module for managing particle vs damap and their attributes
- radiation (with Andrea?).                                                     **

- dispersion in 6D and Chao method (?)                                          **
- true rbend.                                                                   *
- curved quadrupole (eh*k0l) (?).
- focusing sbend (?).
- support for knobs.                                                            **
- high order normal form.                                                       **
- fast tracking (GPU, Threads).                                                 **

todo (extra features):
- readline (rlfe, linenoise), feasible?.
- look at Ceres solvers (Google, C++, GitHub), http://ceres-solver.org
- look at proposed optimiser at http://plato.asu.edu/sub/nonlsq.html.
- look at http://www.swmath.org
