This chapter describes the :type:`matrix` objects as supported by MAD-NG. The module for matrix is not exposed, only the contructors are visible. Thus, matrices are handled directly by their methods or by the generic functions of the same name from the module :mod:`MAD.gmath`. Note that :type:`matrix` are defined as C structure for direct compliance witht the C API.
