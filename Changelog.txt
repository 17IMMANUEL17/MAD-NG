Version 0.9.2 [?]:
- remove clearing at and from after installation to follow general policy to not
  modify user elements.
- add used-defined comparison to method install (and insert_sat) to handle left
  or right insertion of element and sub-element, add operators as strings.
- added element methods insert_sat, replace_sat, remove_sat to thick_element and
  drift_element.
- improve sequence foreach to run through sub-elements with subelem selector.
- improve sequence filter to return index of sub-elements encoded as midx.sat.
- improve sequence install to handle sub-elements and collisions automatically.
- improve sequence remove to remove sub-elements as for normal element.
- improve sequence replace to replace sub-elements as for normal element.
- add mtable rencol to rename a column, useful to transform content of an
  "expected" colunm using column generator.
- unify cmp in bsearch, lsearch, elm:index_sat, and seq:install with table.sort.
- fix problem to write damap in files.
- add slink element, useful for recirculator or energy recovery linac.

Version 0.9.1 [13/10/2020]:
- fix a problem when sequences are built from subsequences defined in separate
  files (e.g. PS).
- sequence install let the user to install elements before or after equal
  s-position.
- fix phase advance for backtracking and the integer part of mu3.
- A lot of cleanup and unification to synchronise the code with the manual.
- Manual is now 181 p., Part I is almost complete but the manual is still far
  incomplete (contains ~20%).
- examples added for FODO, PS, LHC, HL-LHC, CLIC, FCC-ee.

Version 0.9.0 [10/08/2020]:
- first beta3 release.
- draft version of Part I and II of the manual.
- changes vs beta2 is too long

Version 0.8.0 [14/11/2019]:
- first beta2 release.
- changes vs beta1 is too long, no manual yet.
